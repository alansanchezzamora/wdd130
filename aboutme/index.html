    <h2>Alan Sánchez</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Alan Sánchez, I'm 25 years old.  I've been married to my eternal companion Karina for 2 years and have a 1 year old kid named Aaron and a 2 years old Husky dog named Laila. I am from Castaños, México, but now we live in Monterrey, México. It's a desertic zone with hot weather in summer (40° C) and cold weather in winter (0°C).</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church for my entire life. I obtained a testimony from the church the first time I completely read the Book of Mormon. I returned from my missionary service 5 years ago, I served in Tijuana, México. </p>
   <p>Last june (2022) I completed a bachelor's degree in financial management. I'm currently working in a mangement consulting firm, as a business analyst. </p>
    <p>There are 2 main reasons why I'm pursuing the Applied Technology degree. 
        1. I love to learn
        2. I think the skills taught in this program can help me in my curreny career. 
    </p>
    <p> I enjoy spending time with my wife and kid. And taking out Laila for morning runs.
    </p>
