                    <p>We have worked with our clients in the development of <span class="emphasize">Corporate Strategy, Business Strategy, and Functional Strategy.</span>
                    
                    We ensure the presence of the following elements:</p>
                    
                    <li>Strategy is a deliberate search for a plan of action that will develop a business’s competitive advantage and compound it. For any company the search is an iterative process that begins with a recognition of where you are and what you have now.
                    — Bruce Henderson</li>
                    
                    <li>Operational effectiveness (OE) means performing similar activities better than rivals perform them. In contrast, strategic positioning means performing different activities from rivals’ or performing similar activities in different ways
                    — Michael E. Porter</li> </ul>

                    In order to develop a new business, it is imperative to understand and define:</p>
                    
                    <li><span class="emphasize">Business Strategy:</span> The market’s potential, the firm’s value proposition, and the necessary resources</li>
                    <li>Corporate governance: The rules governing the board, its make-up, shareholding, and capital contributions</li>
                    <li><span class="emphasize">Deal Structuring:</span> Understanding the value that each partner contributes, valuing businesses and setting relevant milestones to complete each transaction.</li>
                    <li><span class="emphasize">Entry Strategy:</span> Analyzing alternatives to entering a given market alone, in partnership, or via acquisitions, evaluating candidates for acquisition.</li></ul>
